# Deep Learning Image Recognition Project

This repository contains code for training a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification tasks using TensorFlow's Keras API.

## Overview

The project comprises multiple code blocks organized as follows:

1. **Data Preparation**: Code to load and preprocess image data using `ImageDataGenerator` from specified directories.
2. **Model Architecture**: Building a CNN-based model with specific layers, dropout, regularization, and batch normalization.
3. **Training and Optimization**: Training the model using Adam optimizer with a customized learning rate scheduler and callbacks.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Displaying training/validation accuracy and loss per epoch.
5. **Saving the Model**: Saving the trained model as 'model3.h5'.
